# Test instructions
echo "3. Manual Testing Instructions:"
echo "-------------------------------"
echo "After both servers are running:"
echo 
echo "A. Open browser developer console (F12)"
echo "B. Navigate to http://localhost:3000"
echo "C. You should NOT see:"
echo "   - DOM autocomplete warnings"
echo "   - Rate limiting errors"
echo "   - 404 errors for /public/platform/organization-count"
echo 
echo "D. In the developer console, you can run:"
echo "   - window.devHelper.testBackendConnection()"
echo "   - window.devHelper.testPlatformService()"
echo "   - window.devHelper.clearPlatformCache()"
echo 
echo "E. Check forms (login, register) for proper autocomplete behavior"
echo

echo "🎯 What was fixed:"
echo "=================="
echo "✅ Added autoComplete attributes to all form inputs"
echo "✅ Implemented caching in platformService (1-minute cache)"  
echo "✅ Added rate limiting (2 requests per 2 seconds) for platform endpoints"
echo "✅ Added proper cleanup in React useEffect hooks"
echo "✅ Added debouncing to prevent excessive API calls"
echo "✅ Improved error handling and fallbacks"
echo "✅ Added development debugging tools"
