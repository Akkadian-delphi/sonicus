## **RECOMMENDATION: Start with Option A** ‚úÖ

Given the solid foundation we've built, I recommend **Option A (Quick Fix & Demo Ready)** as it will:

1. ‚úÖ **Demonstrate Value**: Working end-to-end multi-tenant registration
2. ‚úÖ **Build Momentum**: Quick wins while maintaining quality
3. ‚úÖ **Validate Architecture**: Test our DNS infrastructure under real workflow
4. ‚úÖ **Enable User Feedback**: Get early validation of the user experience

This approach allows us to showcase the complete vision while maintaining the flexibility to iterate based on feedback.

**Would you like to proceed with any of these priorities?**
