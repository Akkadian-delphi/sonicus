# B2C User Router Successfully Added! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview
Successfully integrated `user_b2c_simple.py` into the Sonicus application, adding comprehensive B2C user management functionality alongside the existing B2B2C user system.

## ðŸ†• What's Been Added

### New Router: `user_b2c_simple.router`
- **Route Prefix**: `/api/user`
- **Tag**: `user-b2c`
- **Total Endpoints**: 7 new endpoints
- **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT token

## ðŸ“‹ New B2C Endpoints

### ðŸ‘¤ Profile Management
```
GET /api/user/profile
```
- Get user profile with subscription details
- Returns subscription tier, status, trial info, analytics
- Includes wellness streaks, listening hours, session counts

### ðŸ’³ Subscription Management
```
GET /api/user/subscription          - Get detailed subscription info
PUT /api/user/subscription          - Update subscription tier/status  
POST /api/user/start-trial          - Start premium/pro trial

## ðŸ”„ How It Works With Existing System

### Complementary, Not Competitive
- **`user.py`** (B2B2C) = Authentication + Registration + Organization setup
- **`user_b2c_simple.py`** (B2C) = Subscription + Content + Personal analytics

### No Conflicts
- Different route prefixes (`/api/v1/users` vs `/api/user`)
- Different purposes (setup vs ongoing usage)
- Both use same authentication system (`get_current_user`)

## ðŸŽ¯ B2C User Journey Now Supported

GET  /api/v1/users/me       - Get basic profile
```

### 2. Subscription Management (NEW `user_b2c_simple.py`)
```

```
