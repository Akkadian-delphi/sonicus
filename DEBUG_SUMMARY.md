# Sonicus Debug Session Summary
## Date: August 7, 2025

### Issues Identified and Resolved:

#### 1. JWT Authentication Issues ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: JWT tokens were failing validation due to missing 'kid' header
**Solution**: Added fallback mechanism in `backend/app/core/authentik_auth.py` to use first available key when 'kid' is missing

#### 2. API Token Expiration ✅ RESOLVED  
**Problem**: Authentik API tokens were expiring causing 403 errors
**Solution**: Enhanced token validation and error handling

#### 3. Infinite Request Loop ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Frontend was sending infinite API requests with malformed search parameter "function+search%28%29+%7B+%5Bnative+code%5D+%7D"
**Root Cause**: Browser's built-in `search` function was somehow being passed as the search parameter
**Solution**: 
- Added debounced search functionality with 500ms delay
- Added type checking to ensure search parameter is always a string
- Added safety guards in both search input debouncing and API call formation

#### 4. Python Variable Errors ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Undefined `category_filter` variable in backend code
**Solution**: Fixed variable declarations and imports

#### 5. Port Conflicts ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Multiple processes conflicting on same ports
**Solution**: Cleaned up stale processes and ensured proper port allocation

### Code Changes Made:

#### Backend (`backend/app/core/authentik_auth.py`):
```python
# Enhanced JWT token verification with fallback
if kid:
    # Find specific key by kid
    for jwk in jwks.get("keys", []):
        if jwk.get("kid") == kid:
            key = jwk
            break
else:
    # Fallback for tokens without kid
    logger.warning("JWT token missing 'kid' in header, using fallback key selection")
    keys = jwks.get("keys", [])
    if keys:
        key = keys[0]
```

#### Frontend (`frontend/src/pages/BusinessAdminPage.js`):
```javascript
// Added debounced search to prevent infinite loops
const [debouncedSearchQuery, setDebouncedSearchQuery] = useState('');

useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    const safeSearchQuery = typeof searchQuery === 'string' ? searchQuery : '';
    setDebouncedSearchQuery(safeSearchQuery);
  }, 500);
  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [searchQuery]);

// Added type safety in API calls
const searchValue = typeof debouncedSearchQuery === 'string' ? debouncedSearchQuery : '';
```

### Current Status:
- ✅ Backend running successfully on port 18100
- ✅ Frontend running successfully on port 3000  
- ✅ Database connected and operational
- ✅ No infinite request loops
- ✅ JWT authentication working with fallback mechanism
- ✅ All major errors resolved

### Performance Impact:
- Reduced API call frequency from infinite requests to reasonable debounced intervals
- Improved system stability and resource usage
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### Preventive Measures Added:
1. Type checking for search parameters
2. Debouncing for user input to prevent excessive API calls
3. Enhanced error logging for better debugging
4. Fallback mechanisms for authentication edge cases

### Next Steps:
- Monitor system for stability
- Consider implementing additional input validation
- Review other components for similar potential issues
